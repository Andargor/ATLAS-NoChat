# No Chat

This mod disables and hides the chat box, preventing it from taking keyboard focus, even in the inventory. We use it on our private server. 


## BETA

This mod was actually quite tricky to implement, and our gaming group is currently testing it on our server for all use cases (new created character, death, transition to another tile, etc.). So far, so good.

This mod is stackable, unless another mod modifies the chat box (obviously).

If you use this mod on your server, please give us your feedback.

## FAQ

Q: For the chat box, can I change the color/font size/add an option in the settings/INI/have something different?

A: Sorry, our group just wants the chat box to go away, since we use Discord. However, once this is confirmed working on more servers, I should release the sources so that others may make it more customizable.
